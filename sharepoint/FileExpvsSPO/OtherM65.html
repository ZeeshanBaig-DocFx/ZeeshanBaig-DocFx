<h4 id="information-governance">Information Governance</h4>
<h5 id="data-loss-prevention">Data Loss Prevention</h5>
<p>Data loss prevention (DLP) helps you prevent the unintentional or accidental sharing of sensitive information.
DLP examines email messages and files for sensitive information, like a credit card number. Using DLP you can detect sensitive information, and take action such as:
•	Log the event for auditing purposes
•	Display a warning to the end user who is sending the email or sharing the file
•	Actively block email or file sharing from taking place
When the risks of data leakage aren't entirely obvious, it's difficult to work out where exactly you should start with implementing DLP. Fortunately, DLP policies can be run in &quot;test mode&quot;, allowing you to gauge their effectiveness and accuracy before you turn them on.</p>
<h5 id="conditional-access">Conditional Access</h5>
<p>Conditional Access allows administrators to control what Office 365 apps users can gain access to, based on if they pass/fail certain conditions
These conditions are enforced by building a policy (or multiple policies) to control how users access your Office 365 resources.
An example of conditional access would be what applications do we need to control. Conditional Access does not need to apply to all of Office 365, you can be more granular and just control access to specific apps – E.g., SharePoint Online
Based on the condition above, access can be allowed to the Office 365 app with the following conditions:
Require multi-factor authentication– User is allowed in but will need to complete additional security to log in, e.g.:
1.Phone call
2.Text message</p>
<h5 id="privileged-identity-management">Privileged Identity Management</h5>
<p>Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These resources include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.
It provides approval-based role activation to mitigate risk of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about. Some of the key features of Privileged Identity Management are:
1.Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need role
2. Require approval to activate privileged roles
3. Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role</p>
<h5 id="entitlement-management">Entitlement Management</h5>
<p>Enterprise organizations often face challenges when managing employee access to resources such as:
Users may not know what access they should have, and even if they do, they may have difficulty locating the right individuals to approve their access
Once users find and receive access to a resource, they may hold on to access longer than is required for business purposes
The entitlement Management can help address these challenges. Azure AD entitlement management can help you more efficiently manage access to groups, applications, and SharePoint Online sites for internal users, and also for users outside your organization who need access to those resources.
SharePoint Search</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>Both SharePoint and Office 365 provide teams with dedicated collaboration spaces where they can store and share content, exchange ideas, manage their activities, track project progress, and accumulate knowledge. Team and project sites form the basis of team collaboration in SharePoint. In Office 365, teams can combine SharePoint sites with Yammer, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Groups, and project management tools such as Planner or Project Online.</p>
<h5 id="co-authoring">Co-Authoring</h5>
<p>Multiple people can work together on a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation. When everyone is working at the same time, that's called co-authoring.</p>
<h4 id="ms-teams">MS Teams</h4>
<p>Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app built for hybrid work so you and your team stay informed, organized, and connected — all in one place.
Explore how Teams can help you and your colleagues come together no matter where you are:
1.Chat - Message someone or a group to talk about work, projects, or just for fun.
2.Teams - Create a team and channels to gather people together and work in focused spaces with conversations and files.
3.Calendar - Connect with people before, during, and after a meeting so prep and follow-up are easy to find. This Teams calendar syncs with your Outlook one.
4.Apps - Find familiar apps and explore new ones to simplify, customize, and manage how you work.</p>
<h4 id="ms-planner">MS Planner</h4>
<p>With Planner you and your team can create plans, assign tasks, chat about tasks, and see charts of your team’s progress. You can also use Planner from within Microsoft Teams and Microsoft SharePoint.</p>
